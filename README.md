# Energy-Aware Task Migration Framework

This repository implements an **Energy-Aware Task Migration framework** for optimizing server resource utilization and reducing energy consumption in cloud computing environments. The system simulates task placement and migration across multiple servers with varying capacities and efficiencies, providing insights into energy savings and load balancing.

## Features

- **Initial Task Placement**: Efficiently allocates tasks to servers based on resource demands and server capacities.
- **Dynamic Task Migration**: Reduces energy consumption by migrating tasks to more energy-efficient servers.
- **Energy Cost Optimization**: Calculates and minimizes the energy cost for task execution.
- **Detailed Visualizations**:
  - Task distribution across servers.
  - Energy consumption heatmaps.
  - Task migration frequency.
  - Server efficiency vs. load analysis.
